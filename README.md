# My First Website: T-Shirt Creator

- I [wrote about how I built this](//www.harrymt.com/blog/2017/11/15/my-first-website.html).

For a University of Nottingham module I created a T-Shirt site in which the user could edit the appearance of the shirt then place an order for that current T-Shirt.

HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript were used in this project.
